ECG Signal Analysis \& Ionic Discovery (Record 208)

This project provides a robust pipeline for the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) data, specifically utilizing Record 208 from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The analysis transitions from raw signal engineering to advanced unsupervised machine learning to identify pathological states driven by ionic fluctuations.



**Key Features**

**1. Signal Engineering \& Pre-processing**

Dual-Stage Filtering: 

Implements a 3rd-order Butterworth High-Pass filter (0.5 Hz) for baseline wander removal and a 4th-order Low-Pass filter (40 Hz) to eliminate high-frequency muscle noise and powerline interference.

Normalization: Amplitude scaling to ensure consistency across the 30-minute recording.

Spectral Analysis: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to visualize the frequency components of the cardiac signal.



**2. QRS Detection \& HRV Analytics Pan-Tompkins Implementation:** 

Utilizes differentiation, squaring, and moving window integration (MWI) for robust R-peak detection. 

Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Calculation of instantaneous heart rate and R-R intervals to assess autonomic nervous system balance.



**3. Ionic Morphology Discovery -** 

The script isolates specific waveforms to analyse electrolyte-driven cardiac phases:

**Sodium Ion Activity:** Detailed analysis of the P-wave (atrial depolarization) and QRS complex (ventricular depolarization).

**Potassium Ion Recovery:** Zoomed-in morphology of the T-wave (ventricular repolarization).

**Chloride Ion Stress:** Quantitative assessment of the ST-segment level using a strict $\\pm$ 0.15 mV threshold to detect metabolic stress and ischemia.



**4. Machine Learning (K-Means++)Feature Extraction:** 

Beats are clustered based on Sodium (R-peak amplitude) and Chloride (ST-level) features.

**K-Means++ Seeding:** Uses optimized centroid initialization to identify three distinct heartbeat populations:

**Group A:** Baseline/Normal beats.

**Group B/C:** Stressed/Arrhythmic beats (e.g., PVCs or ischemic fluctuations).





**Population Analytics:** Distribution charts to quantify the prevalence of pathological states.





🛠 **Prerequisites**

📊 **Results Summary (Record 208)**

Detection Accuracy: ~89.5% against MIT-BIH annotations.

Mean Heart Rate: ~70.56 BPM.

ST Pathology: Identification of significant ST-segment deviation in approximately 33% of the recorded beats, correlating with the known ventricular arrhythmias in this record.
